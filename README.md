# E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI

## 1. Project Title / Headline
📦 SalesPulse: E-Commerce Insights Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze online retail performance, visualize regional and customer trends, and enable strategic sales decision-making through dynamic visuals and filters.

## 2. Short Description / Purpose
The SalesPulse Dashboard enables business users to explore sales patterns across time, location, and product lines. It provides real-time insights into key performance indicators like revenue, profit, and quantity sold using an intuitive visual interface.

## 3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Report creation, DAX measures, and visuals<br>
• 🔄 Power Query – Data cleaning, merging (Orders Dataset + Details Dataset)<br>
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For KPIs, dynamic filtering, and custom logic<br>
• 📈 Custom Visualizations – Donut charts, bar/column charts, line graphs, map visualizations<br>
• 📁 File Format – .pbit for template sharing; .csv for raw data inputs

## 4. Data Source
Primary Source:

Orders Dataset.csv: Includes Order Date, Region, State, Customer Name, Product Category, Sub-category, Payment Mode, and Amount

Details Dataset.csv: Contains Quantity, Profit, AOV (Average Order Value), and unique Order IDs

The datasets were joined on the Order ID field to unify sales and transaction-level details.

## 5. Features / Highlights
## • Business Problem
Sales managers lacked an efficient way to analyze large volumes of order data and uncover high- and low-performing regions, products, or customer segments. Manual Excel reports were slow and inflexible.

Tracks total sales, profits, and quantities in real-time

Provides drill-down capabilities by region, state, customer, or product line

Identifies top-performing customers and payment modes

Helps optimize category-wise performance and promotional strategies
